# Bengaluru Real Estate House Price Prediction

In this project, the main aim is to predict the prices of houses available in Bengaluru.
The price is mainly based upon the Area, Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and the Locality of the house itself.

It is a Machine Learning project with frontend and backend. The front end was developed and deployed using Flask Server. The backend is powered by Sklearn.

For model and modeling, the first step was data preprocessing which includes outlier detection, anomaly detection, variation, and many other things. It was the toughest part I can say. Once the data was cleaned, the next step was model building, for that GridsearchCV was used with linear regression, lasso, and a decision tree. The straight winner was LinerRegression. Once this was done, the last step was to deploy the project using the flask server.
